# Bits on Air
Bits on Air (BoA) is a P+S-course held at the electrical engineering department at ETH in Zurich.

## The Code
The code written can be used to send and receive data using frequency modulation (FM) in the hearable audio spectrum with two distinct frequencies. The most important files are `send.m` and `receive.m`, which are also (more or less) described. There are also some helper functions to convert any file to a bitsequence (`bitsequenceToFile.m`) and to play and record the generated sounds (`recordsound.m` and `playsound.m`).
